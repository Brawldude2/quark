# Getting Started
1. Make a ScreenGui in StarterGui
2. Add a test local script inside.
## Creating Instances
You can use `Quark.New` to create a new Instance. It takes a string (ClassName). You can then call it again with a table, to set properties.
```lua
-- Require the Quark module and the `New` function
local Quark = require(ReplicatedStorage.Quark)
local New = Quark.New

New "Frame" {
    Parent = script.Parent, -- Set properties inside
    Size = UDim2.fromOffset(100, 100),
    BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1,0,0)
}
```
## Adding Children
Custom properties (used by Quark) are defined starting with lowercase letters. (Such as `children`, `class`, etc.)
```lua
New "Frame" {
    Parent = script.parent,
    Size = UDim2.fromOffset(100, 100),
    BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1,0,0),

    children = {
        New "TextButton" {
            Size = UDim2.fromOffset(75, 30)
        }
    }
}
```
## Event Connections
Quark Supports using properties and functions for creating built-in event connections. Instead of using `.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function())` you can just add it as a property:
```lua
New "TextButton" {
    Parent = script.Parent, -- Set properties inside
    Size = UDim2.fromOffset(100, 100),

    MouseButton1Click = function(self, ...)
        print("Button was clicked!")
    end,
}
```
## Batching Properties
You can call the `New` Object multiple times and set the properties multiple times. This doesn't override the previous properties. (Apart from Quark's custom ones.) Useful for separating parts of your properties or connections, etc.
```lua
local Button = New "TextButton" {
    Parent = parent,
    Size = UDim2.fromOffset(100, 50),
}

Button {
    MouseButton1Down = function(self, ...)
        print('Pressed!')
    end,
    
    MouseButton1Up = function(self, ...)
        print('Released!')
    end,
}
```

There's way more stuff you can do with this, such as using States and Springs as properties, but you can learn that in
