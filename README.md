# Quark
*A simple and easy to use reactive UI library for Roblox.*

It's great for making UI quickly and easily. Still in development, bugs may occur. Especially useful in Stories/Storybooks, with UI Labs. Feel free to make a github Issue on it for bugs/improvements.

## Installation
To install, just use clone this repository or download the Quark.rbxm file from the [Releases](github.com/creepersaur/Quark/Releases).
It's adviced to put the Quark module in ReplicatedStorage.

If you cloned this repo, you can use Rojo (or another linker) to build the place file (or use it without building).
