# Quark
*A simple and easy to use reactive UI library for Roblox.*

It's great for making UI quickly and easily. Still in development, bugs may occur. Especially useful in Stories/Storybooks, with UI Labs. Feel free to make a github Issue on it for bugs/improvements.

## Installation
You can get Quark from the [Roblox Creator Store](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/105183088809550).
It's adviced to put the Quark module in ReplicatedStorage.

If you want the latest code update, just use clone this repository. If you cloned this repo, you can use Rojo (or another linker) to build the place file (or use it without building).

If you want a more "stable" release, download the Quark.rbxm file from the [Releases](github.com/creepersaur/Quark/Releases). (Releases is more stable.)
